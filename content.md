# Final project options

This is an overview of your final project options, so that you can start thinking about what you want to do. This assignment itself has no submission; I will open up other assignments later where you will turn in your projects.

We’re going to have an additional option for the final project this quarter:

1. You can build an idea that I assign. If you go this road, it will be just like a homework, complete with `rake grade`.

2. You can build your own idea from scratch. If you go this road, then you should strive to keep it as simple as possible. Like a real agile software project, pick the smallest functional core to stand up first; we can then add the rest of the features in a sequence informed by feedback.

## Timing

Generally, you won't want to start writing any Ruby for your project until after we've learned how to implement sign-in/sign-out.

If you're planning to build your own app idea, until we get to sign-in/sign-out you can and should be:

- [Noticing pain points.](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html#:~:text=The%20verb%20you%20want%20to%20be%20using%20with%20respect%20to%20startup%20ideas%20is%20not%20%22think%20up%22%20but%20%22notice.%22%20At%20YC%20we%20call%20ideas%20that%20grow%20naturally%20out%20of%20the%20founders%27%20own%20experiences%20%22organic%22%20startup%20ideas.%20The%20most%20successful%20startups%20almost%20all%20begin%20this%20way.)
- Making [rough sketches of solutions](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/242-planning-your-idea#sketches).
- Most importantly, domain model a solution; come up with a very solid data model.
- You're very welcome to book as many office hours appointments as you want to discuss pain points, scope solutions, and refine data models.
- If you want to, you can start writing HTML and CSS mockups of each screen that can be pasted into ERB templates once you're ready to begin on the actual Rails projects.

## Assigned idea

The assigned idea will be a quintessential CRUD application: the social network we’ve been domain modeling, Photogram.

We've built various parts of it in phases, but now you'll be starting from a blank application and building it all out, given the target behavior.

## Your own idea

If you choose to build your own idea, then you should [read the longer description located here](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/242-planning-your-idea). It boils down to: keep it simple. We can always add features after reaching our first target, or after the quarter is over, and quite often do.

## Submission

Depending on which option you choose, you will submit via `rake grade` (assigned idea) or via a text submission on the assignment (your own idea).

(I will publish the assignment for Photogram Final after we've completed building sign-in and sign-out; I don't want anyone to start on it before I demonstrate some tools and shortcuts that will be very helpful.)
